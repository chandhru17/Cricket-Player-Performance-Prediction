# Cricket Player Performance Prediction

## Project Overview
The Cricket Player Performance Prediction project uses R and the Shiny package to predict the performance of cricket players. By analyzing historical match data, the project provides insights into players' future performance against specific teams, bowlers, or in general.

## Features
- **Predictive Modeling:** Utilizes a linear regression model to predict future performance based on historical data.
- **Player-Specific Analysis:** Predicts runs scored by batsmen and runs conceded by bowlers against specific opposing teams.
- **Visual Representations:** Offers graphical visualizations to compare player performances and trends.
- **Color-Coded Team Representation:** Differentiates teams using distinct colors for better visualization and comparison.

## How It Works
1. **Data Loading:** Reads historical match data from CSV files.
2. **Data Filtering:** Filters the data to focus on specific players and opposing teams.
3. **Performance Calculation:** Calculates runs scored by batsmen or runs conceded by bowlers for each match.
4. **Color Picker:** Assigns team colors for visualization purposes based on opposing teams.
5. **Trend Analysis:** Plots player performance data and fits a trend line to visualize performance trends.
6. **Popular Player Comparison:** Compares the predicted performance of selected players against popular players.

## Usage
- **For Batsmen:**
  - Filters the data for specified batsmen and opposing teams.
  - Plots runs scored and balls played for each match.
  - Adds a trend line to visualize performance over time.

- **For Bowlers:**
  - Filters the data for specified bowlers and opposing teams.
  - Plots runs conceded and balls bowled for each match.
  - Adds a trend line to visualize performance over time.

- **Comparative Analysis:**
  - Provides a bar plot to compare predicted scores/runs of specified players against popular players.
  - Uses team-specific colors for better visual differentiation.

## Conclusion
This project provides a comprehensive tool for predicting cricket player performance, helping in strategy formulation and performance evaluation. The visual insights and predictive analysis offer valuable information for players, coaches, and analysts.
